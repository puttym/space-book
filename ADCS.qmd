title: "Why Spacecraft Need Attitude Determination and Control Subsystem (ADCS)"
---
# Introduction {.unnumbered}
The Attitude Determination and Control Subsystem (ADCS) is responsible for
stabilizing a spacecraft and orienting it in the desired direction throughout
its mission. This capability is essential—not optional—for the successful
functioning of most spacecraft. In this post, we focus exclusively on why ADCS
is needed, deferring the topics of sensing, attitude determination, and control
to future posts.

## The Challenge of Space: Disturbance Torques
A spacecraft in orbit is constantly subjected to small but persistent
disturbance torques. These torques originate from environmental sources and fall
into two categories:

1. **Cyclic Torques:** Vary in a periodic (often sinusoidal) manner during an orbit.
2. **Secular Torques:** Accumulate over time and do not average out, causing gradual drift.

If left unopposed, these torques will reorient the spacecraft, disrupting its
mission. ADCS has to counter these torques through:

1. **Passive Methods:** Use the spacecraft's inherent inertia or magnetic properties
to make disturbances stabilizing or tolerable.

2. **Active Methods:** Sense attitude changes and apply corrective torques via
thrusters or actuators.

## Beyond Stability: Repointing and Maneuvering
ADCS is also needed to reorient the spacecraft deliberately. For instance:

- Repointing payloads, and antennas to new targets.
- Correcting orientation after thruster firings, especially during orbit changes.

These tasks often demand more from ADCS than disturbance rejection alone and can
dictate its design.

## Mission Modes That Rely on ADCS
ADCS functionality evolves across different mission phases. Common ADCS modes
include:

1. **Orbit Insertion and Acquisition** When a satellite separates from the
launch vehicle, it begins to tumble due to the release mechanism’s imparted
momentum. ADCS must:

- Sense the tumbling rate.
- Perform **detumbling** to stabilize the satellite.
- Reorient the satellite to maximize solar power generation, which requires:
    - Knowing the Sun’s direction.
    - Determining current attitude.
    - Rotating the satellite or adjusting the solar panels.

For high-altitude orbits, satellites may be inserted into transfer orbits and
maneuvered later. Thruster firings during this process can disturb attitude and
must be corrected by ADCS.

2. **Normal (On-Station) Mode**

In this primary operational phase, the satellite carries out its mission. ADCS must:

- Maintain correct orientation.
- Continuously reject cyclic and secular disturbance torques.

ADCS design is often driven by the requirements of this mode, since the
satellite spends most of its life here.

3. **Slew Mode**

"Slew" refers to rotating the spacecraft. Slewing is required when:

- The satellite needs to change its pointing direction.
- Targets move, especially in the case of fast-moving objects like missiles.

Some missions have moderate slew requirements (e.g., Earth observation), while
others demand rapid, agile slews.

4. **Safe Mode (Contingency)**

Activated during emergencies, this mode prioritizes:

- Preserving power.
- Maintaining thermal safety.
- Sacrificing mission performance if necessary.

5. **Special Mode**

Used during **known, temporary** conditions such as eclipses. For example:

- During an eclipse, Sun sensors don’t work.
- ADCS must switch to alternate attitude sensing methods.
- Pre-planned handling avoids unnecessary transition to Safe Mode.

## Common Sources of Disturbance Torques
- **Gravity-gradient torque**
    - Constant for Earth-pointing satellites
    - Depends on spacecraft inertia and orbit altitude

- **Solar radiation pressure torque**
    - Cyclic for Earth-oriented spacecraft
    - Influenced by geometry of the spacecraft, surface reflectivity, and centre
    of gravity (CG)

- **Magnetic torque**
    - Cyclic in nature
    - Depends on the residual dipole moment of the satellite, orbit altitude, and inclination

- **Aerodynamic torque**
    - Present in lower orbits
    - Affected by atmospheric drag, spacecraft shape, and CG location

## Conclusion
Attitude control is fundamental to almost every aspect of spacecraft
operations—from staying stable in space to pointing antennas and sensors at
precise targets. Whether resisting subtle environmental disturbances or carrying
out rapid, mission-critical slews, the ADCS ensures the spacecraft does what it
was built to do.
