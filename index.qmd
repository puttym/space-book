# Why I'm Writing This Book {.unnumbered}

A few years ago, I used to work in the space industry. Then, like it does for
many of us, life took its own course. I stepped away from that world — not
entirely by choice — and found myself on a very different path. But the pull of
space never really went away.

This book is part of my return mission.

I’ve been revisiting foundational texts in orbital mechanics, space systems, and
mission design — and as I read, I write. Each chapter in this book started as a
self-study article: my attempt to understand something clearly and explain it
carefully. The goal is to make these topics accessible without losing technical
precision.

I’m sharing my work in public — mostly through LinkedIn — and using that
momentum to reconnect with people in the field. It’s not always comfortable to
learn in public, but at this stage, there’s no other way. If anything, it keeps
me honest and consistent.

The mission is already underway.
