# Introduction

Welcome to *An Introduction to Space Systems*. This book is a personal journey through the principles, mathematics, and technologies behind satellite missions.

You may start reading from any chapter, but we recommend beginning with [Orbital Mechanics](GEC.qmd). If you want to learn about ADCS, then we recommend [ADCS](ADCS.qmd)

See Equation @eq-demo-eq and Section @sec-structure for examples of references.

## The Structure of This Book {#sec-structure}

This book is divided into two parts:

- **Orbital Mechanics**: Basics of orbits, coordinate systems, and orbital elements.
- **Satellite Subsystems**: ADCS, power, communication, and more.

## A Demo Equation

A simple math example for reference:

$$
E = mc^2
$$ {#eq-demo-eq}
