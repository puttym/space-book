title: "Geocentric Coordinate Systems"

# Overview

Geocentric coordinate systems are centered at the Earth's center. This chapter introduces the geocentric equatorial frame and related systems.

See also the orbital elements in Section @sec-orb-elements.

## Coordinate Frames

We define a right-handed coordinate system with:

- X-axis pointing toward the vernal equinox
- Z-axis along the Earth's rotation axis

## Example Equation

The position vector $\vec{r}$ can be expressed as:

$$
\vec{r} = x \hat{i} + y \hat{j} + z \hat{k}
$$ {#eq-position-vector}
